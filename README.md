# Reddit Top 2.5 Million

## Huh?
This is a dataset of the top 1000 all-time posts from the top 2500 subreddits by subscriber pulled between August 15-20 of August 2013.

Each file is a CSV with the related subreddit as its filename. Each CSV file contains a header line.

## Why?
I plan to use this for some data analysis I'm putting together for [/r/serendipity](http://www.reddit.com/r/serendipity). You're free to do whatever you like with it.

## Gotchas?

Yes, one: This only includes subreddits that are *not marked NSFW*. This is related to my particular use case, in which NSFW subreddits aren't useful for me. They'd be relatively easy to scrape if you're interested, you'll just need to get the list of NSFW subreddits from http://www.reddit.com/reddits.
